		<h4> History </h4>
		<p>Seneca opened in 1967 as part of a provincial initiative to establish an Ontario-wide network of colleges of applied arts and technology providing career-oriented diploma and certificate courses, as well as continuing education programs to Ontario communities. The province was responding to the increasing need for sophisticated applied learning as technology continued to change the nature of work and the provincial economy. General education was considered an important element in postsecondary education, and breadth courses continue to be a part of every program. In 2001 colleges were granted the ability to offer baccalaureate degrees. Seneca is one of six colleges that can offer up to 15 per cent of its program activity at the degree level.</p>
		<h4>International</h4>
		<p>Seneca has been active in international education for decades and now attracts more than 3,500 international students each year. The largest sending countries are, in order, China, India and South Korea, followed by Russia, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Seneca's English Language Institute prepares international students for post-secondary study through intensive language training that can last anywhere from two months to more than a year. The college has several partnerships with overseas institutions and is expanded its activities in joint applied research and work/study abroad options.</p>
		<h4>Concerts </h4>
		<p>The Grateful Dead performed at Seneca College's Field House on November 2, 1977. Other famous artists who performed in the late seventies at Seneca were Patti Smith,Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, Thin Lizzy (1977), and Iggy Pop among others. </p>
